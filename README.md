# Gender Classifier

### Goal:
I used this small project to practice data science using python. I have previously learnt many machine learning concepts in college using R, but using the free time I have to explore machine learning with Python.  
 Python, arguably, has many more advantage over R when using machine learning and deep learning concepts. 

### Purpose:
The purpose of this python script was to explore the different classifiers that the scikit-learn package in python has.  
The script runs through a programatically defined dataset and spits out the best performed classifier out of the four. 

### Classifiers used:

1. Decision Tree Classifier
2. Support Vector Classifier
3. Multi-layer Perception Classifier
4. Nearest Neighbors Classifer

Inspiration for this script came from [Siraj Raval] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5pRlIbr6gg&list=PL2-dafEMk2A6QKz1mrk1uIGfHkC1zZ6UU&index=1)
